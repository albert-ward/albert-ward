Hi, I'm a PhD candidate in political science at the University of Oxford. I mostly do things in public opinion and behavioural science, but 
also political methodology (especially causal inference and experiments), and quantitative social science generally.

If you're a QStep student, you can access course materials <a href="https://github.com/albert-ward/qstep1-course">here.</a>

You can get in touch with me at albert.ward@politics.ox.ac.uk or albertjamesward@gmail.com
